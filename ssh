To check for ssh-agent on Windows with OpenSSH, follow these steps:

Open a command prompt by pressing the Windows key + R, typing "cmd", and then pressing Enter.

Type the command "ssh-agent" and press Enter. This will start the ssh-agent service, if it is not already running.

If the ssh-agent service is already running, you will see output similar to the following:


SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-Hko1scCcV7bW/agent.12345; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK;
SSH_AGENT_PID=12345; export SSH_AGENT_PID;
echo Agent pid 12345;
If the ssh-agent service is not running, you will see output similar to the following:

Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.
If you see the "Could not open a connection to your authentication agent" error, you can start the ssh-agent service by typing the following command:

eval $(ssh-agent)
After starting the ssh-agent service, you can use the "ssh-add" command to add your private key to the ssh-agent. This will allow you to authenticate with remote servers without having to enter your password every time.
Note: OpenSSH is not installed by default on Windows, so you may need to install it manually.
